<p>Athens, the capital of Greece was once a cradle for western civilization.  The first known democracy was established in the 6th century.. Athens is also home to the Parthenon, the acropolis museum, and sculptures, vasas and jewelry from ancient Greece.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p> The city is home to the Acropolis; a citadel with ancient buildings, built in the 5th Century BC. The Acropolis is where ancient philosophers like Plato and Socrates posed questions about the universe and democracy. </p>
<br>
<hr>
<p>Built in 447 BCE with marble columns that thinned towards the top, the Parthenon built to dedicate the goddess Athena, is a must see attraction. The Parthenon played many roles throughout history.  It was converted into a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary. After the Ottoman Conquest, it became a mosque. During the siege of the Acropolis, the Parthenon became damaged and so were its sculptures, due to its state being in the state it is in today.
