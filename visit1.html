<p>The most magnificent thing about Santorini is the architecture. The village is distinguished for its “sugar cubed” houses, the cobblestone paved streets all overlooking the crystal blue Agean sea. The architecture of the island makes it a great location to practice parkour. In addition to exhilarating sports, take in the most beautiful sunset of your life. Witness the orange sun dipping into the sea every night, this making Santorini a popular wedding destination.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p>Besides the picturesque village and architecture, there are tons of historicals sites to visit. Such as the sandy beaches like Kamari or the Red beach. There are museums and churches. The most ancient site is Minoan Akrotiri , a town that was mostly covered with volcanic ash due to the volcano of Santorini erupting in about 1600 BC. </p>

<p>Other than visiting ancient sites, there are tons to do in Santorini, like visiting the volcano, bus tours around the island, scuba diving, sailing, kitesurfing, and some of the best restuarants.</p>
